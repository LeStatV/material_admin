## Clean-up oganization To-Do
Since this is just a POC, code is not very well organized and needs to be matured. here is what I see so far:

- [ ] Make JS features optional in settings
- [ ] Move SCSS out of admin.scss into sub components (e.g. navigation, buttons, forms (done), etc.)
- [ ] move preprocess functions into .inc files and out of .theme
- [ ] Better way to handle materializecss overrides
- [ ] Remove Classy as a parent theme entirely?
